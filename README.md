# ICMP_Sniffing_Tool

## This is the final course assignment before course project.

### Running ICMP Sniffing Tool:

#### 1: Clone project or download zip file to any linux environment (Works in some variants of linux).
#### 2: Open 2 terminal windows and navigate to the projects location using the command cd <dir name>.
#### 3: In one terminal (Doesn't matter which), run command > 'make'
#### 4: In one terminal run command > 'sudo ./Sniffer' . This will start sniffing packets.
#### 5: On the other terminal run comman > 'sudo ./icmp' . This will send out an ICMP packet to Google.com (8.8.8.8)

### 6: The 2 packets are captured, as well as all other ICMP packets (Could be pings, etc...).
